README

This file explains how to use the maclookup bash script.

If you are using MS Windows (uuuggghhh!) remember to “dos2unix” the script AFTER copying to the system that will run the script.

You must be root to execute the script.  The script requires executable permissions to launch ( chmod a+x).

The script will save output to file named “/tmp/maclookup.json”.  

If the script fails, it will log errors to “/tmp/maclookup.log”.  If an invalid MAC address is input, the online API will return an error code and the script will exit.
