README

This file explains how to use the maclookup bash script.

Copy the script to the /tmp directory on your docker host (running linux).

If you are using MS Windows (uuuggghhh!) top copy the file, please remember to "dos2unix" the script AFTER copying to the system that will run the script.

After it is copied to your docker host running linux, issue this command to copy it to your container:

docker cp /tmp/maclookup.sh  container:/tmp/maclookup.sh

(container above is the name of your container, remember to change it)

The copy command is also included in the Dockerfile.

You must be root to execute the script.  The script requires executable permissions to launch ( chmod a+x).

The script will save output to file named "/tmp/maclookup.json".  

If the script fails, it will log errors to "/tmp/maclookup.log".  If an invalid MAC address is input, the online API will return an error code and the script will exit.
